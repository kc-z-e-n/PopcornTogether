# Orbital 25 Milestone 1

## Team Name:  

PopcornTogether

## Proposed Level of Achievement:  
Apollo 11



## Motivation  
With the proliferation of movies in cinemas and streaming platforms, it may be overwhelming for users to identify what movies they would like to watch. This is especially so when they are searching with friends and family, trying to find a  film they can watch together. 


## Aim  
We aim to create a website with features to easily allow users to discover, find, and curate a watchlist of movies. Additionally, other movie watchers users can connect with helps strengthen the community. 


## User Stories

- As a user who wants to find a movie that fits my mood today, I want to be able to type genres or actors etc. I want to see into the search bar to find movies that apply.  
- As a user who wants to see if a movie is worth watching or not, I want to click into the community reviews section and see what other people are saying about it after watching.  
- As a user who wants to remember what movies I have watched and also want to watch, I want to enter the watch statistics page and view everything I have saved.  
- As a user who wants to see what my friends are watching, I want to add them to my friends list to keep track and stay connected with them.  
- As a user who wants to find a movie both my friends and I will enjoy, I hope to use the movie match feature to swipe on suggested movies together and see if there are any we both are interested in watching.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Movie Search**: User specifies a list of filters for the type of movie they want recommended (runtime, genre, actors, release date, etc.). Search then produces a list of matching movies.  
- **Watchlist and Wishlist**: User can track movies they have watched before by adding a film to the watchlist. Users can also track movies they want to watch in the wishlist. This would affect the results of their searches, watched movies will be excluded and wishlisted movies will be top of relevant searches.
- **Friends List**: Users will be able to add each other as friends to connect, share Watchlists, and use the Movie Match function (extension).  
- **Watch Statistics**: Users can save and organize movies they want to and have already watched, making it easy to track recommendations and upcoming releases. Users can also share their watch statistics with friends or create collaborative lists.

### Extension Features
- **Movie Match**: User chooses a set of filters, and a "for you" page is generated where they can swipe up/down to navigate recommendations, swipe left to discard, or swipe right to add to the watchlist.  
- **Community Reviews**: Users can rate, review, and discuss movies, creating a shared space for insights and recommendations.
